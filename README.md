# Empirical study and comparison of models via Multiclass Classification and NLP
This project is based on Sentiment analysis and it leverages NLP to analyze Textual Data consisting of Covid19 Tweets. The project aims to analyze datasets from a social point of view to help understand people's perceptions during the pandemic. It incorporates various machine learning models to classify the tweets and opinions into a segregated class by assigning polarity scores.The results have been plotted in the form of graphs by making use of Python libraries and frameworks.
It incorporates various Machine Learning models and algorithms to perform an empirical analysis and comparision of the different algorithms based on their computed accuracy,precision,recall and F1 Scores.
The Machine Learning and Deep Learning models used in this project are: LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), Back Propagation Neural Network, Random Forests Classifier, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier and Count Vectorizer models.
NLP's python libraries like TextBlob and vader sentiment are leveraged to perform sentiment anaysis of the collected preprocessed tweets data.
Neural Network libraries such as Keras and Tensor Flow are used for Deep learning techniques to evaluate the model's performance for apt classification of texts and tweets.
